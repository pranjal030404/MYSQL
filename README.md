# MYSQL

This is repo for all the query of mysql workbench so we can check all the update ASAP if we found any problem in github then we can just check all the error and find the query for it's solution

Basically in this I provide all the codes which are used for simple changes and updates and all the basic to advance commands in this .

Hope it contribute something in your profession or carrer...

For downloading mysql in your own device you can go to this link so this can continue from here and work on mysql workbench which will be directly connected to the server so that we can use it in our system "https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer"

Thank you
